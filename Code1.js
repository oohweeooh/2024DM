If you won as Sanders, I would advise you to play VK/yeah's 2016 Sanders mod. It's a lot of fun and shows the difference he would've made in the race. If you won as O'Malley, play the 'Sequel to 2016 Democratic Primaries'.</p><h4>Books</h4><p>I recommend both Clinton and Sanders' books on the topic. <i>Our Revolution</i> and <i>What Happened</i> (to a lesser extent) get more in depth into the primaries themselves, but first-hand perspective is always valuable - especially at understanding the strategies of the campaigns. Of course, it's always important to get outsider perspective as well.<br><br>Bernie Sanders - <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Where-We-Go-Here-Resistance/dp/1250163269' target='_blank'>Where We Go From Here: Two Years In The Resistance</a><br>Bernie Sanders - <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Our-Revolution-Believe-Bernie-Sanders/dp/1250132924' target='_blank'>Our Revolution</a><br>Hillary Clinton - <a href='https://www.amazon.com/What-Happened-Hillary-Rodham-Clinton/dp/1501175564' target='_blank'>What Happened</a></p><h4>News Sources</h4>I can't list them all here, but coverage of the primaries, such as news from the time such as Sanders' <i>Daily News</i> incident really helped. Lots of <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Politico</i>, and <i>NBC</i> were used while researching. On the ground coverage is really valuable, if you can find any. Of course, it's more difficult for older elections.<br></p><h4>Debate Footage</h4><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDqZIgcSYtI&ab_channel=USPresidentialDebates' target='_blank'>Third Democratic Primary Debate - ABC News, 12/19/2015</a><br><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti2Nokoq1J4&ab_channel=NBCNews' target='_blank'>NBC News - YouTube Democratic Debate</a><br><br>Again, even if I was unable to list it all here, debate footage can be really valuable. You get to see the campaigns' strategies face off head-to-head, and you can see examples, such as Clinton attempting to flank Sanders from the left on issues such as Gun Control. It also makes for decent background audio when coding or writing.<br><br></p><h4>Election Results, Polling Data</h4><a href='https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2016&off=0&elect=1&f=0' target='_blank'>2016 Presidential Democratic Primary Election Results - US Elections Atlas</a><br><a href='https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/primary-calendar-and-results.html' target='_blank'><i>The New York Times</i> - 2016 Presidential Primaries Results</a><br><br>US Elections Atlas also had lots of polling data, and its clear that the polls were off in a lot of Midwestern states in the primaries, perhaps a sign of things to come? It's not always easy to incorporate large polling errors into mods, but I tried my best here, and I think it turned out pretty good.<br><br></p> <h4>Music</h4>All credits to music are placed within the soundtrack.

I did a lot more writing than usual but I had received a lot of very useful and cool ideas (Stuff such as Sanders' use of CYOA, and Clinton being able to choose when to start her campaign were Sparkie and RouteVenus' ideas). Greeleycrat and Obummer were also very helpful playtesters who helped me squash a lot of grammatical and coding errors. Thank you to DecstarG and CatBoxXD for helping with the technical stuff too.
