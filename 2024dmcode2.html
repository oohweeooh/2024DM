      <p>Hey!</p>
This mod has been a lot–and taken a lot from me.</p>
For quite a while, I thought I’d have more to say on this–but we’re within 12 hours of release as I write this, and I’m frankly very drained at the moment. Democracy’s Martyrdom as the idea first came to me in late February, and now, in early October, we’ve made it. The scores of questions and errors and CYOA and everything I learned is going to stay with me for a while, as are the amount of people who have expressed such kindness and an eagerness to play the finished product. I truly do hope I live up to expectations.</p>
Anywho–onto talking about the mod. It’s been a lot, and I bet there will be a contingent of disappointed people here. Yes, it’s a fakeout. Yes, it’s not really an 8 candidate mod like many were expecting—though there are 8 different nominees who can all have questions where they are the playable ones. Given the saturation of 2024 mods, I don’t expect this to be too sorely felt as a missed opportunity.</p>
I’m so incredibly grateful to each and every person who worked on this mod–I expected it to just be me bugging Rome about it for a few months and I’d release it in early July, but now it’s a huge staff team mod with a lot of people working on it, and it’s been delayed 2 official times Either way, we’re here now.</p>
Thank you so much, everyone. Also I do not hate iranians.</p>
      <h4>Special Thanks</h4>
      Hamcrackers, as always, for being one of the most wonderful people I know.<br><br>
      A certain IRL friend of mine who I’m grateful to for being so supportive.<br></p>
      Lawrence Eagleburger, for having that name and inspiring this whole mod.<br></p>

      <p>Hey!</p>
This mod has been a lot–and taken a lot from me.</p>
For quite a while, I thought I’d have more to say on this–but we’re within 12 hours of release as I write this, and I’m frankly very drained at the moment. Democracy’s Martyrdom as the idea first came to me in late February, and now, in early October, we’ve made it. The scores of questions and errors and CYOA and everything I learned is going to stay with me for a while, as are the amount of people who have expressed such kindness and an eagerness to play the finished product. I truly do hope I live up to expectations.</p>
Anywho–onto talking about the mod. It’s been a lot, and I bet there will be a contingent of disappointed people here. Yes, it’s a fakeout. Yes, it’s not really an 8 candidate mod like many were expecting—though there are 8 different nominees who can all have questions where they are the playable ones. Given the saturation of 2024 mods, I don’t expect this to be too sorely felt as a missed opportunity.</p>
I’m so incredibly grateful to each and every person who worked on this mod–I expected it to just be me bugging Rome about it for a few months and I’d release it in early July, but now it’s a huge staff team mod with a lot of people working on it, and it’s been delayed 2 official times Either way, we’re here now.</p>
Thank you so much, everyone.</p>
      <h4>Special Thanks</h4>
      Hamcrackers, as always, for being one of the most wonderful people I know.<br><br>
      A certain IRL friend of mine who I’m grateful to for being so supportive.<br></p>
      Lawrence Eagleburger, for having that name and inspiring this whole mod.<br></p>

      <h4 style='margin-top: 0.5em;'>Director’s Commentary</h4>
      <p>Hey!</p>
This mod has been a lot–and taken a lot from me.</p>
For quite a while, I thought I’d have more to say on this–but we’re within 12 hours of release as I write this, and I’m frankly very drained at the moment. Democracy’s Martyrdom as the idea first came to me in late February, and now, in early October, we’ve made it. The scores of questions and errors and CYOA and everything I learned is going to stay with me for a while, as are the amount of people who have expressed such kindness and an eagerness to play the finished product. I truly do hope I live up to expectations.</p>
Anywho–onto talking about the mod. It’s been a lot, and I bet there will be a contingent of disappointed people here. Yes, it’s a fakeout. Yes, it’s not really an 8 candidate mod like many were expecting—though there are 8 different nominees who can all have questions where they are the playable ones. Given the saturation of 2024 mods, I don’t expect this to be too sorely felt as a missed opportunity.</p>
I’m so incredibly grateful to each and every person who worked on this mod–I expected it to just be me bugging Rome about it for a few months and I’d release it in early July, but now it’s a huge staff team mod with a lot of people working on it, and it’s been delayed 2 official times Either way, we’re here now.</p>
Thank you so much, everyone.</p>
      <h4>Special Thanks</h4>
      Hamcrackers, as always, for being one of the most wonderful people I know.<br><br>
      A certain IRL friend of mine who I’m grateful to for being so supportive.<br></p>
      Lawrence Eagleburger, for having that name and inspiring this whole mod.<br></p>

Another American base in Iran is under attack, and it’s taking up all the headlines. Servicemen dead, grieving families sticking the blame on you, Congress in uproar. NATO allies are trying to scale back their commitments regardless, but you know it’s only going to make things worse. Polls say your popularity is dipping heavily under the brunt of the situation, and that people see Iran as your greatest failure. You turn off the TV and get back to work. You can fix this.</p><p>The secretary's opinions are unanimous: leaving would be on the level of the Afghanistan debacle. You have to stay long enough to bring some form of peace before bringing the troops home. Liberals are in uproar when you make an Oval Office address saying the same. Just watch me, you mutter under your breath.</p><p>December 18th, 2025:</p><p>The long-forecasted recession has hit--it could be worse, but it’s sending people into a panic. Congress is scattered and stonewalled, unable to get any comprehensive stimulus through. You float the idea of tax cuts to incentivise the Republicans to come to the negotiation table, but all it does is enrage the left wing further and push you further underwater in approval ratings.</p><p>Inflation begins to soar when you try to re-incentivize purchasing, and the Feds overcorrection against it leaves many considering your administration's response to the recession worse than the recession itself. You spend the next year under scrutiny for it, unable to pass any real laws.</p><p>July 4th, 2026:</p><p>A terrorist attack. Another. It’s nowhere near the level of March 7th, but a bombing in Nashville has sent the GOP into uproar. Public fear spikes again, and allegations the terrorists crossed the southern border lead to an impeachment inquiry that thankfully stalls out before getting anywhere.</p><p>You fire the Secretary of Homeland Security before Congress can, and move to clamp down on the border. Kids in cages, the left alleges, how can you condone it? You sigh. You’re trying.</p><p>January 6th, 2027:</p><p>The long awaited event has happened–Donald Trump has announced his fourth consecutive bid for the Presidency. He looks awful, being live streamed to a mega-crowd in Florida from his cell. Even as Nikki Haley and Brian Kemp try to challenge him, you know it won’t avail them. He’ll be back.</p><p>You decide, right then and there, that you’re going to beat him again. You’re the only living man who can.</p><p>November 7th, 2028:</p><p>You don’t. Your hands cover your face as the results come in. You can hardly bear the mass of polls showing how the voters disapprove of your administration, how even Democrats believe Trump was better on the economy. The grief won’t go away. It will never go away.</p><p>Ending 40 of 50</p>"

A complex vehicle for you, given your background in foreign affairs, an economy that remained unstable your entire term took a toll on your approval ratings under the weight of constant GOP attacks on your administration. </p><p>Interest rates fluctuated up and down through your term, as did inflation. Stock market confidence, rallied by your ability to make the country safer, dropped year after year when it became clear economic confidence was simply not going to be restored in your administration.</p><p>What consumed you more than the economy, though, was the war in Iran. The early stages of success quickly faded into a slog of resistance and a crumbling level of international support. Your early dreams of establishing a stable government, fighting the terrorists, and pulling out quickly faded and wouldn’t be realized until after your administration was long gone.</p><p>Iranian resistance efforts were hard to understand and claimed the lives of too many American servicemen to feel any sort of comfortable with. When the GOP won a striking majority in the House of Representatives during the midterms, a censure motion found it’s way through Congress condemning you for your action–spearheaded by Senator Ron DeSantis.</p><p>As a veteran and a young face, he quickly became one of the most predominant national names in Congress during your tenure, and had a history of economic success during his governorship of Florida that contrasted well with your failure on both the foreign and economic fronts of your Presidency. Learning to abandon the culture war that served him so poorly in 2024, his 2028 bid found it’s mark among the GOP base, and eventually among the general electorate. Serving for eight years, DeSantis would be one of the most popular Presidents of the early 21st century.</p><p>Ending 41 of 50</p>"

As Iran’s new government was established, all things considered, rather stabily, your success on the foreign stage was cemented. Though the country is far from stable still, it became a success story unlike Afghanistan, Iraq, or Vietnam.</p><p>At home too, there were successes to be proud of. Amidst a country still living with fear of another attack, your administration was able to successfully crack down on international and domestic terror cells and prevent any major attacks from ever occurring. At the southern border, crime and drug importation wound down as well, though a praise less sung by your own party and especially by Republicans in Congress.</p><p>Of course, not everything was perfect. While your laser focused earned plaudits abroad, the domestic economy never quite stabilized in the way that was expected. Stimuli were begged for by corporations who didn’t deserve it, and rollercoastering inflation levels did bring down your once-stellar approval ratings. Though the jobs market never dipped into depression, Biden’s economy never quite returned in full-force, which weighed on Democrats at the ballot box.</p><p>The GOP, looking to exploit this overall economic discontent, began a lengthy battle to see who could best connect with voters feeling the pinch at the pump or at the wallet. While several candidates rose and fell, one, claiming he could best represent the rust belt voter out of a job under your administration, eventually cast aside his rivals to win the nomination. JD Vance sought to reclaim the White House for a GOP lost in the woods.</p><p>While he tried to press your administration, and the candidate of the Democratic Party, on issues both abroad and domestic, his paltry war record and eye-patch from March 7th just didn’t stack up against the living success story of the McDonough administration. While it was too close for comfort, he was dispatched at the ballot box and your legacy was cemented.</p><p>Ending 42 of 50</p>"

Efforts to enact anti-trust on monopolies failed spectacularly and crippled already low business confidence in your administration tanking the economy further.</p><p>Further, while the occupation in Iran was going well, overall national security… wasn’t. The border crisis, ignored for some time due to the mega-drama of the Capitol Bombing and the situation in Iran, roared back to the headlines as another migrant caravan arrived.</p><p>With associated drug crises growing larger and larger, GOP voices began to call for a reshuffling of the department of Homeland Security. To prevent an impeachment, you obliged–infuriating the left wing of your party even more.

Beyond the stock market though, it wasn’t all sunshine and roses over your four years.</p><p>Terrorist attacks in Iran quickly surged by insurgent forces seeking to repel American occupiers, and the NSC remained continually incapable of properly striking back. Your administration shifted through CIA and FBI heads quicker than you could keep track of, as scandals involving national security surged.</p><p>At the border too, immigration officials were quickly swamped with a number of immigrants they were simply unequipped to deal with, and the few incidents of high profile-murder by illegal immigrants took things to the next level. The Homeland Security department was swamped, and after an impeachment vote passed the House, you fired the secretary to stop the firestorm before it went too far.</p><p>When you announced that your administration would be staying in Iran for a few years longer, due to the rising death toll and frequency of terror attacks, public backlash for a broken promise and an overall failing rained down on you from the right and left combined. Defeating the terrorists, though a priority for many, seemed secondary to the masses' fury.</p><p>Your booming economy went the way of Biden—overshadowed by fears of issues abroad and at home. Polls showed average Americans becoming more and more scared, more so than the immediate aftermath of March 7th, and people’s views of you as a strong leader plummeted also. Looking for a strongman to stop the crime and a soldier to win the war in Iran, soldier turned sheriff turned Governor Joe Lombardo took the scene.</p><p>Though having to reckon with his past, more anti-Trump persona, a simple pledge to pardon him abated a serious split from all but the furthest right sections of the party–and with a unified party and a tough-guy persona, he was able to saddle into the White House in January 2029.</p><p>Ending 44 of 50</p>"

While the country would never experience true stability, it became a much greater long-term victory for the US than Afghanistan or Iraq ever could–similarly to how your Presidency would be viewed in the long-term. </p><p>While your success at mediating issues with foreign leaders was stellar, your success with business leaders was surprisingly similar.

While many tried and failed to say that they’d make the best opposition to a third Democratic term, Governor Abbott of Texas charmed the GOP electorate with his anti-migrant campaign.</p><p>Though many did rate him higher on the issue of national security, the DNC was able to do what many saw as one of Biden’s greatest failures and was able to turn the economy into a winning campaign tactic.

While no idyllic paradise, fears of another March 7th kept on going down throughout your Presidency, and more and more citizens began to report that they felt good about the country.</p><p>Border apprehensions and illegal immigration numbers began to drop, as did opioid and fentanyl deaths, which appeared to significantly ease the national anxiety. Presidential addresses when terror cells were dismantled led to higher public trust in your administration, and every high profile terrorist defeat or apprehension at home seemed to further reinforce this sense of national progress. With an economy on the upswing to boot, things were looking good for the future.</p><p>Though many expected your administration to not be as hospitable to a booming economy as Biden or Trump was, you were able to help continue the expansion of American jobs that had begun under your predecessor and prevent any major economic recession or other terrible crash. People began to feel better and better about the countries economy as you governed, leading to the first time in years where Republicans reported a good economy under a Democratic President. Rising employment and gradually decreasing inflation helped add some confidence to the rattled nation, and stock market confidence only climbed as your administration proved a steady hand over the country.</p><p>Of course, not everything was perfect. In Iran, reconstruction efforts lagged behind every schedule and every delay you added to try and mediate. Roads and schools were frequently sabotaged by insurgents, and the time you had to keep direct ground troops in became a stinging wound with your approval rating with the left wing of the country. When finally the more than doubled peacekeeping force arrived, they were met with revulsion by many in Iran.</p><p>With high profile military issues live on TV in front of America, the Republican party decided it had found it’s angle on how it would try and take Democrats down in the 2028 election. Despite the many veterans and foreign policy focused candidates trying to make the case that they alone could carry the banner of victory in Iran, the victor was a familiar face to many in the country. Nikki Haley, with her vows to finish the job, won a bruising primary for President.</p><p>Democrats had long feared a match with her due to her approval ratings among moderates, but her tack to the right in the primary matched with a domestic tranquility tailor-fit to serve Independents created a cocktail of success for Democrats. As Haley spent most of the campaign trying to fend off Trumpist attacks on her record, the infighting consumed her campaign and gave Democrats another term with the Presidency.</p><p>Ending 46 of 50</p>"

Though you scoffed at this, it would hold for two more cycles before you got bumped down to spot number six. All in all, the historical analysis generally goes that you rescued America from one of it’s darkest depths and brought it to a new height.</p><p>In Iran, a potentially volatile situation with a rogue state and a possible insurgency stabilized quickly due to your expertise in the field—the pan-national occupation effort was able to more or less create some national unity to the newly reconstructed republic, and except for a few unfortunate incidents, keep American soldiers from encountering any major defeats or debacles while occupying the country.</p><p>Many felt your success in Iran was in large part due to your anti-terrorist operations there, which were able to prevent any major attacks on US bases or US soil during your administration. The national security afforded to the state of Iran was, indeed, replicated at home under your steady hand as well.</p><p>Every terrorist cell you eliminated saw your approval rating tick higher and higher from its brief drop during the mudslinging of the 2024 campaign. With illegal border crossings dropping for four consecutive years under your guidance, crime along the southern border and drug importation began to fall commensurately, a praise sung by your administration and democrats up and down the ballots. With your successful guidance of the security of the homeland, your party was rewarded with historic midterm gains.</p><p>As the second half of your term progressed, the economy began to soar back to the heights it was under Biden. With the American jobs market back on the upswing, the domestic market responded positively with interest rate cuts and an inflation rate staying low for two more years. Able to pass a middle-class tax cut and bring down the deficit with a congress finally willing to tax the billionaires, your effectiveness as President remains hard to dispute to this day.</p><p>The GOP, reeling from midterm defeats and lost on a larger scale, had few of it’s large names step up to contest the 2028 election–even so, though, it was a bruising primary the whole way through. With few pillars to stand on save relentless attacks on your administration, the master of attacking, Vivek Ramaswamy, stood at the RNC as the victor.</p><p>The election was a lap for Democrats—Ramaswamy was condemned so thoroughly by Republicans that even Bush came out to say he wouldn’t be voting for him, and the MAGA wing split the instance Ramaswamy distanced himself from Trump. In a modern landslide, he was dispatched, and a few months later, you were rated as the fourth best President in American history.</p><p>Ending 47 of 50</p>"

Trump cried and clamored that it had to be fraud, but America was resoundingly in your favor.

A voting rights act and statehood for DC came along too, before the midterms narrowly took the House of Representatives away from you. </p><p>While the GOP ranted and raved and tried to impeach you–your support among them never reached the heights it did with the general public–it never went anywhere, and the minor progress you could get done with a just a Senate in your hands amounted to replacing Clarence Thomas—a long awaited victory for many on the left.</p><p>The economy seemed to perk up too at your effective governance, and as the remaining provisions of the IRA and BIL rolled out, business began to soar across the country. The growing economic boom allowed you to fund a well-managed rebuilding effort across Iran and support shelters for migrant families and more immigration judges to work at reducing the crisis at the southern border.</p><p>As 2028 rolled around, your initial plans not to stand for re-election came under fire from many in th party. As Trump used his claims of mass fraud in 2024 to fund and support his once-crippled support in the GOP primary, Democrats fear of another Trump presidency were powerful agents in convincing you that your modern landslide would only stick if you ran again.</p><p>When finally you announced, the campaign became a breeze.

Called the trial of the century by many, United States of America vs. Mark Milley may mark a turning point in the justice system depending on its decision. </p><p>With no statute of limitations on the serious crime alleged against Milley, his indictments alleges that he committed “dereliction of duty with the intent to cause harm against United States citizens and weaken the Government of the United States” during the waning years of the first Trump administration. The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is facing these allegations due to his conduct at the infamous St. John's Church photo op in June 2020, as well as several meetings he held and reported comments he made about securing President Biden’s inauguration and preventing a military coup by the outgoing first Trump administration.</p><p>According to the book I Alone Can Fix It, Milley compared Trump’s rhetoric and actions following the 2020 election to Adolf Hitler’s when he couped the German government before his Nazi regime came to power---and reportedly took actions to prepare for attempts by Trump before and after January 6th that would resemble a coup. According to the prosecutors, Milley sought to undermine the authority of the Commander in Chief by issuing separate orders and “lacking loyalty or a will to serve following June 1st, 2020.” Further, by asking to be briefed on all military orders given directy by President Trump after January 6th, the US. Government alleges Milley attempted to subvert Government control and cripple the military in case of an attack. Despite not occurring for another three years, the prosecution has even alleged that Milley’s actions could have led to March 7th.</p><p>While no treason case has ever been tried on these terms in the past, many feel that Judge Don Willett has been overly sympathetic to the prosecutions case, and that the concerns over basis may not matter constitutionally. The defense has tried many different strategies thusfar to prevent a conviction--first and most importantly by alleging that no acts committed by Milley actually harmed the United States’ national security at all, secondly by accusing the trial of being politically motivated. As many have commented over the course of the trial, there is  a case that the trial is more about personal vendetta by President Trump than an actual national security threat posed by the retired general. With arguments ending Wednesday, it seems the trial may finally be nearing an end.</p><p>If convicted, Milley will likely face the death penalty.</p><p>Ending 37 of 50.</p>"]

After much controversy about which architect will be commissioned and whether or not the rebuilding will simply recreate the original capitol or be a new design, British architect Patrik Schumacher has been commissioned to construct the new building.</p><p>Controversial, and often described as “fascist”, Schumacher has become known for his buildings constructed in China--including the Morpheus Hotel and Beijing Daxing airport--as well as his conservative views. His firm, the Zaha Hadid Architects, have even built Metaverse cities. Often teased as the far right's favorite choice for rebuilding the capitool, rather than a more contemporary neo-classical architect. </p><p>After news of his being teased as one of the more prominent choices for architects by powerful Republicans---and a truth social post extolling his values by former President Donald Trump, a leaked draft of a rebuilt capitol went viral on X. Showing a two building model for the House and Senate with a statue out front, the building, when 3D Modeled and viewed from the south side, depicts a striking visage of Donald Trump’s head.</p><p>Though Schumacher himself denied the draft being his, leaked memos showed him giving “special consideration” to a building that could evoke Trump when viewed, with President Trump calling him in for an Oval Office meeting days after the leaked draft was released to the public. While the President never pushed to give him the contract following the meeting, the recent Government shutdown featured an amendment proposed by Florida Representative Matt Gaetz to grant Schumacher the commission. Among other fierce debates and provisions over foreign aid and Social Security, many allege the amendment “snuck through” the ranks of more moderate republicans that had objected to the provided budget.</p><p>With President Trump now signing this years budget into law, it’s now only a matter of time before a final blueprint will be released.

While many have criticized the deal for supposed capitulation to Russia–with a little over a quarter of former Ukrainian land officially now integrated Russian states–many in global conservative parties have praised a successful negotiation process for happening and a de-escalation of Russian-Western tensions.</p><p>Much of the credit for the deal has gone to President Donald Trump, in large part due to his own claims that without him the war would still be continuing. However, many on the political left have taken to accusing Trump of causing a Ukrainian “defeat” in the war as a result of the 2025 legislation passed on a party-line vote to withhold Ukrainian, humanitarian and military, until Ukraine began substantial leadership reforms. While met with European condemnation, it was seen as largely contributing to former President Zelensky’s decision to abdicate in favor of then-General Valerii Zaluzhnyi to accede to American demands.</p><p>However, as American and European assistance again dried up in the spring months of 2026, President Zaluzhnyi’s decision to end martial law and call snap elections to try and gain an international mandate has been what many have actually rooted the peace deal in. The much scrutinized election led to the victory of the formerly pro-Russian Restoration of Ukraine party bloc and an eventual appointment of one of it’s leaders, Yuriy Boyko, as interim President following Zaluzhnyi’s resignation–causing many to believe a rapprochement with Russia was near, despite Boyko’s outward political shifts towards Europe. President Trump for his part, has extensively praise Boyko as a “political genius” and “bright man.”</p><p>Only a few months after Boyko’s ascendancy and a looming spring offensive by Russian forces, the first serious bilateral peace talks of the war were held in Geneva, and one year ago today, a finalized deal was signed. Despite the outward description of the deal as not prohibiting Ukrainian membership in the EU or NATO, many observers have described it as increasingly unlikely that the country ever joins either. To celebrate the anniversary of the war ending, Prime Ministers Meloni, Orban, and Wilders, joined with Chancellor Merz and Presidents Trump, Le Pen, and naturally, Boyko to watch a Ukrainian military parade.</p><p>Though this deal has raised President Trump’s domestic approval ratings, he is now under increasing pressure to end the Israeli war on terror that has continued to face unpopularity in the United States as the March 7th bombings have faded into the background of American politics. The American occupation of Iran, though, continues to consistently win public approval. With any Democratic frontrunner maintaining a wide lead in polls, President Trump’s Republican successor may end up just as embattled as Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p><p>Ending 32 of 50.</p>"]

With the federal Department of education, and many associated grants, now totally out of the picture for many poorer Americans, college has become more of a dream than a reality to a good chunk of Americans that could’ve accessed it just a few years ago.</p><p>Further, with increasing politicization of state universities and a gradual decline in classes on issues like race, gender, and identity, many left-leaning students across the country are now vying for spots solely at the top universities, where little has yet changed so radically. As campuses have become smaller and more conservative, a ripple effect has sent city students with good college applications abroad rather than in-country to avoid what they see as an inhospitable environment on state campuses.</p><p>This refuge in elite schools may not last for long, though. The Trump administration has already announced its plans to tax endowments--which may shut the door on yet more students reaching these top universities, and to continue a crackdown which has begun on the high school level on how funds are provided to states and universities if they are found teaching content that uses terms like “gender identity.”</p><p>Though the effects have not yet quite been seen, already we’ve seen a large uptick in the overall amount of young people graduating high school and college that identify as “strongly conservative”, a trend we expect to repeat over the next few years---especially as the first generation to experience the effects of March 7th come to adulthood with the growing American desire for revenge.</p><p>Ending 36 of 50.</p>"]

Even as some Republicans have tried to resist his radical agenda, Trump has steamrolled forward and is on track to inflict more damage unless we stop him with a HUGE victory in these upcoming midterm elections.</p><p>While Trump has already started cracking down on the availability of medication to ensure Reproductive Rights, Kevin Roberts wants him to go farther. Like he wrote in Project 2025, he wants to unconstitutionally ban abortion nationwide without congress and lock up women who try to get one even in states where it’s legal. Further, Roberts wants to eradicate the LGBTQ+ population of our country and move America backwards to a time before gay marriage was legal and repeal the Equality Act. He could inflict massive damage on this country as Chief of Staff, and fighting him must be the goal of all Democrats.</p><p>Already we’re seeing the effects of Donald Trump’s voter suppression law across the board in early voting, and that’s why we need you to RUSH a $20 donation right now to keep Democrats in the House and Senate in contention even as Democrats nationwide are being disenfranchised by Trump’s MAGA agenda. If we want to have any hope of stopping him and bringing our nation back, we have to win these elections, and we can’t do it without loyal Democrats like you.</p><p>President Joe Biden once said that “Failure at some point in your life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable.” We may have lost in 2024, but we CANNOT give up the fight for a fairer and more just America.

The Governments of China, Russia, and North Korea all issued various “No comment” answers, while Prime Minister Meloni and other right-leaning European leaders have condemned the move. Prime Ministers Trudeau and Starmer have both expressed disappointment with President West, but have issued statements pledging their allegiance to keeping NATO strong in cooperation with the United States.</p><p>Impeachment hearings against President West are scheduled to begin next Monday, though face roadblocks given the Green-Democrat fusion that holds a slim majority in the House.</p><p>Ending 50 of 50.</p>"]

Johnson</p><p>If there’s anything to be gleaned from the past few years, it’s that America is in the dumps. Yes, even after we defeated the greatest menace to our democracy in the 21th century two years ago, no one is as ecstatic about it as we thought. Some have even gone as far to say that they are nostalgic for the time when the entire country was united, rallied around then-President McDonough as we recovered from a time of national heartbreak. That’s why it has become evidently clear to me that our current President, Gavin Newsom, should take a page out of his predecessor’s book, and not be the nominee of the Democratic Party in 2028.</p><p>Let’s face it: the President already has a lot to be proud of. Iran is on the backpedal, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza are ending, and the nation feels like it’s not on fire anymore. But, the economy, once competitive under Trump and Biden, has become sluggish. Nearly two in three Americans, according to a new poll, say that the economy is on the wrong track. The President is likely to face stiff opposition during the general election from his left flank, upset with the speed of the Gaza war (and now the viciousness of the one in Iran), and his “young person” charm in 2024 has undergone an astonishing flare-out in just three short years…</p><p>If President Newsom can’t command public approval in the rface of a Republican party as dangerous as ever, he should step aside and let former Governor Whitmer or even Senator Gallego take the reins.</p><p> Ending 4 of 50.</p>"]

Maybe the Senator will run again in 2032, but let’s be honest, few Republicans are eager to take on another Presidential bid, least of all Brian Kemp.</p><p>Immediately after the election, many prominent Republicans, including Vivek Ramaswamy, made sure that they got their claims of fraud in well and early, but it’s really not all that complicated. One need look no further than Alan Licthman’s Keys to the Presidency.</p><p>Yes, the same Keys that predicted Trump all the way back in 2016 would’ve told you that President Newsom was actually fully capable of winning re-election, and for a few simple reasons. His 9 keys were lit up green by our economy and his relatively inoffensive governance, so while many may not have been enthused by our President, his re-election was no mystery. With no March 7th attacks being repeated and a relative feeling of security settling in over the country, Kemp just didn’t get what he needed to shake up this race.</p><p>The root of this all is this: Democrats can govern well, and that’s why they keep getting elected.

With the midterms approaching quickly, Senate Republicans seem unlikely to advance such a hallmark Democratic law--with some, like Republican Senator Tre Hargett calling on Newsom to “drop this proposal and get back to work on securing our borders.” Further, even as Democrats hold a House majority, the initial distrust of Newsom’s programs may lead to a defeat for the law if it comes to a vote.

Despite the constitution saying this would occur on March 4th instead, the argument goes that when the 21st amendment changed the date of Presidential inaugurations, it retroactively changed the date of all other Presidential references to the inauguration date.</p><p>Further, a bipartisan pick may be hard to find. While some have floated former Vice President Mike Pence–usually to be paired with former Vice President Al Gore as his Vice President, the idea has little momentum in either camp. </p><p>What this move may do, however, is flip the New York delegation ever closer to Trump’s side. As the former President is at 25 state votes already, just a few Democrats defecting to abstain could flip the contested delegation into his hands and deliver him the Presidency.</p><p>Ending 18 of 50.</p>"]

After a lengthy primary and eventual defeat, President Phillips left the Democratic party, a move which many say helped Clinton in the election. In the 2028 Republican Primary, businessman and son of former President Donald Trump Donald Trump Jr. defeated Speaker of the House Kevin Hern and former UN ambassador Nikki Haley.</p><p>The election campaign was widely seen as a battle of personalities, with both candidates having the lowest approval rating of any Presidential candidate in modern American History. Clinton’s two past Presidential campaigns were a frequent focus of attack by the Trump Jr. campaign, with the supposed nepotism of Trump’s nomination a leading attack from Democratic forces. On election day, Trump’s victory was met with nationwide riots and a slump in American markets.</p><p>Ending 21 of 50.</p>"]

Joining us now is constitutional law expert Laurence Tribe to discuss Democrat’s options. Laurence?</p><p>Laurence Tribe: Thanks Andrea–well, the situation here is very esoteric to a lot of people, but the Democrats status in contesting Trump’s election was dire before, and is possibly more dire now. As quite a lot of people have reported, the math is just not there for Democrats to have enough state delegations to elect Phillips as President, and with his official endorsement of Trump now forthcoming, Democrats are unlikely to be able to muster any crossover Republican support. Though the party did flip the Montana delegation—bringing the total delegation count of the GOP down to 25, one short of being able to elect Trump–three tied delegations mean that the Democrats only have 22 delegations, also unable to elect a President.</p><p>Andrea Mitchell: Interesting, Laurence. And what’s this quorum plan that Democrats have begun to entertain?</p><p>Laurence Tribe: Well, it all comes back to the twelfth amendment. That amendment, the one that describes how the contingent election works, says that if more than ⅓ of states don’t have a single congressman at the contingent election, quorum can’t be met—</p><p>Andrea Mitchell: And the Democratic Senate would effectively choose the next President.</p><p>Laurence Tribe: Exactly. However, Democrats only have every congressional seat from 11 states, and they’d need 17 states to not show up to be able to delay the election. Though, this congress is slightly more malleable with numbers and ideology–due to many of them not even being in the political sphere before March 7th. This gambit is last minute, and I don’t think it’s poised very well for success, Andrea.</p><p>Andrea Mitchell: Thank you Laurence, and we’ll keep you all at home posted on which Democrats sign on to this bid.</p><p>Ending 22 of 50.</p>"]

Called the trial of the century by many, United States of America vs. Mark Milley may mark a turning point in the justice system depending on its decision. </p><p>With no statute of limitations on the serious crime alleged against Milley, his indictments alleges that he committed “dereliction of duty with the intent to cause harm against United States citizens and weaken the Government of the United States” during the waning years of the first Trump administration. The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is facing these allegations due to his conduct at the infamous St. John's Church photo op in June 2020, as well as several meetings he held and reported comments he made about securing President Biden’s inauguration and preventing a military coup by the outgoing first Trump administration.</p><p>According to the book I Alone Can Fix It, Milley compared Trump’s rhetoric and actions following the 2020 election to Adolf Hitler’s when he couped the German government before his Nazi regime came to power---and reportedly took actions to prepare for attempts by Trump before and after January 6th that would resemble a coup. According to the prosecutors, Milley sought to undermine the authority of the Commander in Chief by issuing separate orders and “lacking loyalty or a will to serve following June 1st, 2020.” Further, by asking to be briefed on all military orders given directy by President Trump after January 6th, the US. Government alleges Milley attempted to subvert Government control and cripple the military in case of an attack. Despite not occurring for another three years, the prosecution has even alleged that Milley’s actions could have led to March 7th.</p><p>While no treason case has ever been tried on these terms in the past, many feel that Judge Don Willett has been overly sympathetic to the prosecutions case, and that the concerns over basis may not matter constitutionally. The defense has tried many different strategies thusfar to prevent a conviction--first and most importantly by alleging that no acts committed by Milley actually harmed the United States’ national security at all, secondly by accusing the trial of being politically motivated. As many have commented over the course of the trial, there is  a case that the trial is more about personal vendetta by President Trump than an actual national security threat posed by the retired general. With arguments ending Wednesday, it seems the trial may finally be nearing an end.</p><p>If convicted, Milley will likely face the death penalty.</p><p>Ending 37 of 50.</p>"]

After much controversy about which architect will be commissioned and whether or not the rebuilding will simply recreate the original capitol or be a new design, British architect Patrik Schumacher has been commissioned to construct the new building.</p><p>Controversial, and often described as “fascist”, Schumacher has become known for his buildings constructed in China--including the Morpheus Hotel and Beijing Daxing airport--as well as his conservative views. His firm, the Zaha Hadid Architects, have even built Metaverse cities. Often teased as the far right's favorite choice for rebuilding the capitool, rather than a more contemporary neo-classical architect. </p><p>After news of his being teased as one of the more prominent choices for architects by powerful Republicans---and a truth social post extolling his values by former President Donald Trump, a leaked draft of a rebuilt capitol went viral on X. Showing a two building model for the House and Senate with a statue out front, the building, when 3D Modeled and viewed from the south side, depicts a striking visage of Donald Trump’s head.</p><p>Though Schumacher himself denied the draft being his, leaked memos showed him giving “special consideration” to a building that could evoke Trump when viewed, with President Trump calling him in for an Oval Office meeting days after the leaked draft was released to the public. While the President never pushed to give him the contract following the meeting, the recent Government shutdown featured an amendment proposed by Florida Representative Matt Gaetz to grant Schumacher the commission. Among other fierce debates and provisions over foreign aid and Social Security, many allege the amendment “snuck through” the ranks of more moderate republicans that had objected to the provided budget.</p><p>With President Trump now signing this years budget into law, it’s now only a matter of time before a final blueprint will be released.

While many have criticized the deal for supposed capitulation to Russia–with a little over a quarter of former Ukrainian land officially now integrated Russian states–many in global conservative parties have praised a successful negotiation process for happening and a de-escalation of Russian-Western tensions.</p><p>Much of the credit for the deal has gone to President Donald Trump, in large part due to his own claims that without him the war would still be continuing. However, many on the political left have taken to accusing Trump of causing a Ukrainian “defeat” in the war as a result of the 2025 legislation passed on a party-line vote to withhold Ukrainian, humanitarian and military, until Ukraine began substantial leadership reforms. While met with European condemnation, it was seen as largely contributing to former President Zelensky’s decision to abdicate in favor of then-General Valerii Zaluzhnyi to accede to American demands.</p><p>However, as American and European assistance again dried up in the spring months of 2026, President Zaluzhnyi’s decision to end martial law and call snap elections to try and gain an international mandate has been what many have actually rooted the peace deal in. The much scrutinized election led to the victory of the formerly pro-Russian Restoration of Ukraine party bloc and an eventual appointment of one of it’s leaders, Yuriy Boyko, as interim President following Zaluzhnyi’s resignation–causing many to believe a rapprochement with Russia was near, despite Boyko’s outward political shifts towards Europe. President Trump for his part, has extensively praise Boyko as a “political genius” and “bright man.”</p><p>Only a few months after Boyko’s ascendancy and a looming spring offensive by Russian forces, the first serious bilateral peace talks of the war were held in Geneva, and one year ago today, a finalized deal was signed. Despite the outward description of the deal as not prohibiting Ukrainian membership in the EU or NATO, many observers have described it as increasingly unlikely that the country ever joins either. To celebrate the anniversary of the war ending, Prime Ministers Meloni, Orban, and Wilders, joined with Chancellor Merz and Presidents Trump, Le Pen, and naturally, Boyko to watch a Ukrainian military parade.</p><p>Though this deal has raised President Trump’s domestic approval ratings, he is now under increasing pressure to end the Israeli war on terror that has continued to face unpopularity in the United States as the March 7th bombings have faded into the background of American politics. The American occupation of Iran, though, continues to consistently win public approval. With any Democratic frontrunner maintaining a wide lead in polls, President Trump’s Republican successor may end up just as embattled as Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p><p>Ending 32 of 50.</p>"]

We advise members worried about the safety of their account to delete any and all messages from the past that may violate these terms, as we are required to search through past messages and ban previous violators.</p><p>I understand this may come as a surprise to many of you, but this is a necessary step that we believe will shield our server from liability concerns or the removal that faced our Reddit.

With the federal Department of education, and many associated grants, now totally out of the picture for many poorer Americans, college has become more of a dream than a reality to a good chunk of Americans that could’ve accessed it just a few years ago.</p><p>Further, with increasing politicization of state universities and a gradual decline in classes on issues like race, gender, and identity, many left-leaning students across the country are now vying for spots solely at the top universities, where little has yet changed so radically. As campuses have become smaller and more conservative, a ripple effect has sent city students with good college applications abroad rather than in-country to avoid what they see as an inhospitable environment on state campuses.</p><p>This refuge in elite schools may not last for long, though. The Trump administration has already announced its plans to tax endowments--which may shut the door on yet more students reaching these top universities, and to continue a crackdown which has begun on the high school level on how funds are provided to states and universities if they are found teaching content that uses terms like “gender identity.”</p><p>Though the effects have not yet quite been seen, already we’ve seen a large uptick in the overall amount of young people graduating high school and college that identify as “strongly conservative”, a trend we expect to repeat over the next few years---especially as the first generation to experience the effects of March 7th come to adulthood with the growing American desire for revenge.</p><p>Ending 36 of 50.</p>"]

If that’s all you need to know to rush a donation, please do. Otherwise, read on.</p><p>In case you don’t know, Kevin Roberts was President of the Heritage Foundation--the organization that’s authored the extreme MAGA Project 2025 plan that Trump has already begun enacting nationwide. Even as some Republicans have tried to resist his radical agenda, Trump has steamrolled forward and is on track to inflict more damage unless we stop him with a HUGE victory in these upcoming midterm elections.</p><p>While Trump has already started cracking down on the availability of medication to ensure Reproductive Rights, Kevin Roberts wants him to go farther. Like he wrote in Project 2025, he wants to unconstitutionally ban abortion nationwide without congress and lock up women who try to get one even in states where it’s legal. Further, Roberts wants to eradicate the LGBTQ+ population of our country and move America backwards to a time before gay marriage was legal and repeal the Equality Act. He could inflict massive damage on this country as Chief of Staff, and fighting him must be the goal of all Democrats.</p><p>Already we’re seeing the effects of Donald Trump’s voter suppression law across the board in early voting, and that’s why we need you to RUSH a $20 donation right now to keep Democrats in the House and Senate in contention even as Democrats nationwide are being disenfranchised by Trump’s MAGA agenda. If we want to have any hope of stopping him and bringing our nation back, we have to win these elections, and we can’t do it without loyal Democrats like you.</p><p>President Joe Biden once said that “Failure at some point in your life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable.” We may have lost in 2024, but we CANNOT give up the fight for a fairer and more just America.
